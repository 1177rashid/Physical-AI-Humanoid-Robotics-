# Digital Twins in Robotics

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time simulation, monitoring, and optimization. In robotics, digital twins serve as powerful tools for developing, testing, and deploying robotic systems in safe, controlled virtual environments before real-world implementation.

## What are Digital Twins?

A digital twin is a dynamic virtual representation of a physical system that uses real-time data to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning about its performance. In robotics, digital twins bridge the gap between simulation and reality, providing:

- **Virtual Prototyping**: Test robot designs and algorithms in simulation
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Mirror physical robot behavior in virtual space
- **Predictive Analysis**: Anticipate system failures and optimize performance
- **Safe Testing**: Experiment with new behaviors without physical risk

## Key Components of Robotic Digital Twins
