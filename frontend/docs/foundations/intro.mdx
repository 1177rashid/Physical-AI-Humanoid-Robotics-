# Foundations of Physical AI

This module covers the fundamental concepts of Physical AI - the integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems. Physical AI connects digital intelligence to the physical world through sensors, actuators, and embodied agents.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to AI systems that interact with and operate in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital domains, Physical AI systems must handle:

- **Sensing**: Gathering information from the physical environment
- **Perception**: Interpreting sensor data to understand the environment
- **Planning**: Making decisions about how to act in the physical world
- **Control**: Executing actions through physical systems

## Key Concepts

### Embodied Cognition

Embodied cognition suggests that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. This is crucial for humanoid robots as their physical form influences their cognitive processes.

### Sensorimotor Integration

Physical AI systems must seamlessly integrate sensory input with motor output to perform tasks effectively in real-world environments.

### Real-Time Processing

Physical AI systems typically operate under real-time constraints, requiring rapid processing and response to environmental changes.

## Applications in Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots represent a pinnacle application of Physical AI, requiring sophisticated integration of multiple AI disciplines:

- Natural language processing for human interaction
- Computer vision for environmental understanding
- Motion planning for locomotion and manipulation
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive behavior

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1. Explain the principles of Physical AI and embodied cognition
2. Identify key differences between digital AI and Physical AI
3. Recognize the challenges specific to Physical AI systems
4. Understand the role of Physical AI in humanoid robotics

## Next Steps

Continue to the next module to learn about the ROS 2 nervous system that coordinates these Physical AI capabilities in humanoid robots.
