# Humanoid Robot Control Systems

Humanoid robot control systems represent one of the most challenging domains in robotics, requiring sophisticated algorithms to manage complex multi-degree-of-freedom systems while maintaining balance, executing tasks, and interacting safely with humans and environments.

## Overview of Humanoid Control Challenges

Humanoid robots present unique control challenges compared to simpler robotic systems:
