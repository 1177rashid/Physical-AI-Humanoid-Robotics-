# ROS 2 Nervous System

This module introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the nervous system for humanoid robots. ROS 2 provides the communication framework that connects sensors, actuators, and processing units in a coordinated system.

## Introduction to ROS 2

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

### Key Features of ROS 2

- **Communication**: Message passing between robot processes
- **Tools**: Utilities for introspection and debugging
- **Capabilities**: Hardware abstraction and device drivers
- **Package Management**: Building and distribution tools

## Architecture

ROS 2 uses a distributed architecture where multiple processes (nodes) communicate with each other using messages passed through topics, services, and actions.

### Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a ROS 2 program. Each node is a process that performs computation. Nodes communicate with other nodes by passing messages through topics, services, and actions.

### Topics and Messages

Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. Publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive messages from topics.

### Services

Services provide a request-response mechanism for inter-process communication. A service client sends a request to a service server and waits for a response.

### Actions

Actions are similar to services, but they are designed for long-running tasks that may take a significant amount of time to complete.

## ROS 2 in Humanoid Robotics

For humanoid robots, ROS 2 serves as the nervous system by coordinating:

- Sensor data acquisition and processing
- Motor control and feedback
- Perception and planning modules
- Human-robot interaction interfaces

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1. Understand the ROS 2 architecture and its components
2. Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes
3. Implement publishers and subscribers
4. Use services and actions for robot communication
5. Appreciate how ROS 2 coordinates humanoid robot systems

## Hands-on Lab

In the associated lab exercise, you'll create a simple ROS 2 package that implements a publisher-subscriber pair to simulate sensor and actuator communication in a humanoid robot system.
